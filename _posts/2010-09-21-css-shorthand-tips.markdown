If you want to write efficient and optimized CSS code then you'll surely need to have in mind the following shorthand tips.

These tips and tricks apparently don't seem to be so important at the first sight. But once you write thousands of CSS lines you will wish to optimize every single line.

Why's that? Because loading speed does matter (Google introduced this to their ranking algorithms) and your web pages will load faster because your stylesheet file size will be smaller.

Below I will present you a short, yet comprehensive CSS shorthand guide to help you get started optimizing your CSS file. So let's have a look at some examples and see exactly how we can optimize a CSS file.

### 1.Background properties in one line

Defining a background property could be made in an easier way than we often happen to see.

Why using:

{% highlight css %}
background: url(example.gif);
background-color: #eaeaea ;
background-repeat: repeat-x;
background-position: top left;
{% endhighlight %}    

... when you could easier write:

{% highlight css %}
background: #eaeaea url(example.gif) repeat-x top left;
{% endhighlight %}

### 2.Border property

When all of the border widths are the same, instead using:

{% highlight css %}
border-color: red;
border-width: 1px;
border-style: solid;
{% endhighlight %}

... you can simply write this:

{% highlight css %}
border: 1px solid red;
{% endhighlight %}

### 3.List properties


The following list properties:

{% highlight css %}
list-style-position: outside;
list-style-image: none;
list-style-type: disc;
{% endhighlight %}
    
... could be simplified into:

{% highlight css %}
list-style: disc outside;
/* shorthand notation for list properties */
/* list-style: [list-style-type] [list-style-position] [list-style-image];*/
{% endhighlight %}   

### 4.Font and line-height properties

Font and line-height properties like the ones below:

{% highlight css %}
font-family: Arial, Helvetica;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: italic;
font-size: 1em;
line-height: 1.5em;
{% endhighlight %}    

... can be easily transformed into:

{% highlight css %}
font: bold italic 1em/1.5em Arial, Helvetica;
{% endhighlight %}   

Much simpler huh? :)

### 5.Margin and padding properties

This example applies for margin and also for padding, so next we'll use as example the CSS margin property.

{% highlight css %}
/* top=10px, right=5px, bottom=15px, left=20px */
margin: 10px 5px 15px 20px;

/* top=10px, right=5px, bottom=10px, left=5px*/
margin: 10px 5px;

/* top=10px, right=5px, bottom=15px, left=5px*/
margin: 10px 5px 15px;
{% endhighlight %}  

Now let's see what else we can do to write optimized CSS:

### Always remember that "0" anyhing equals to "0"

Use the "0" value instead 0px or 0em  so instead the the following [CSS properties](/things-you-should-know-about-css-anatomy)

{% highlight css %}
margin: 0px;
padding: 0em;
{% endhighlight %}

you could use:

{% highlight css %}
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
{% endhighlight %} 

### Use shortcuts for hexadecimal colors

White color equal to "#ffffff" or just "#fff",  #aabbcc can be wrote like #abc and so on.

### Simplify non integer CSS values

Instead writing 0.5em you can use .5em, 0.5px is equal to .5px

### The last property semicolon it's not required?

{% highlight css %}
div {
margin: 0;
padding: 0 /* note that you can skip the last rule semicolon, and yes it passes W3C validation */
}
{% endhighlight %}
    
### Floated elements inherits "display:block" declaration

When floating an element there's no need to add also "display: block" declaration as we often see. This is helpful for avoiding redundancy and save us one line of CSS.

These are some CSS shorthand tips I often use and they are very helpful for me, when coding CSS. I hope they will also help you writing shorter, better CSS code.
